# 🟣 Meetzy

**Meetzy** is a full-stack MERN-based real-time video calling and chat application that enables seamless peer-to-peer video and audio communication with integrated text chat functionality. Built using **Socket.IO**, **WebRTC**, and **STUN servers**, it delivers low-latency communication with a modern responsive UI powered by **MUI** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Peer-to-peer video calling using **WebRTC**
- 🔊 Real-time audio/video streaming with STUN server support
- 💬 Instant text chat using **Socket.IO**
- 📡 WebSocket-based real-time connection management
- 👤 Authentication & user management 
- 🧑‍💻 Responsive and mobile-friendly UI (MUI + Tailwind)
- 🌐 Deployed on [Render](https://meetzyfe.onrender.com)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React 19**
- **Vite** for fast dev/build
- **Tailwind CSS** & **Material UI (MUI)** for styling
- **Socket.IO Client**
- **React Router v7**

### Backend

- **Node.js** & **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**
- **Socket.IO Server**
- **WebRTC** with STUN server integration
- **dotenv**, **http-status**, **bcrypt** for Authentication and other utilities

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aayush-Roy/Meetzy.git
cd Meetzy
````

### 2. Setup the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file with your environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, STUN/TURN server config).

### 3. Setup the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` (or configured Vite port).

## 🌐 STUN / TURN Configuration

Meetzy uses free **STUN** servers to establish direct peer-to-peer connections. You can also integrate **TURN** servers for production use cases where NAT traversal is needed.

Example WebRTC config:

```js
const config = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" },
    // TURN servers can be added here
  ],
};
```

## ✨ Future Enhancements

* [ ] Add TURN server support for restrictive networks
* [ ] Group video calls
* [ ] Authentication and private rooms
* [ ] File sharing
* [ ] Push notifications
